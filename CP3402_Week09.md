### Estimated Hours
I spent around 3 hours watching videos and coding. 


### Content Insights
Working with Sass provided practical experience in enhancing CSS with variables, mixins, and nesting. I found that integrating these features into a real project significantly improved my understanding of Sass. Experimenting with a personal project, like creating a drink-themed website, helped solidify my knowledge and showed the practical benefits of using Sass over plain CSS.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week's experiment underscored the value of hands-on learning and self-directed exploration. By diving into Sass and building a project from scratch, I developed a deeper grasp of styling techniques and their application in real-world scenarios. This approach not only improved my technical skills but also demonstrated the importance of being adaptable and proactive in learning new technologies. In a professional setting, such skills are invaluable for problem-solving and innovation. The ability to independently find and apply solutions will be crucial as I advance in my career, making self-directed learning a powerful tool for ongoing development.
