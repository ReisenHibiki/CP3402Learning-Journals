### Estimated Hours
We spent around 2 hours having meetings and setting up working environment for the group. I spent another 3 hours designing theme and managing wordpress server.


### Content Insights
I learned that as the administrator of the server. I can give users access to edit the website and contribute to the developing. I also learned that security is a big problem in developing. I should only give the lowest permission for developers to complete their work. And remove that after they finished the work. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Wordpress provides a good environment for teamwork. It shows that access control plays a important role in security. Working with tools like Slack, GitHub, and AWS demonstrates your ability to collaborate effectively in a team. A WordPress developer will often work alongside designers, content creators, and other developers. Clear communication, task allocation, and version control are essential skills.
