### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I set up a beautiful website by learning bootstrap. I watched linkedin to know what skills and techs I should learn by myself. I learned github.io tutorials and put my website online[Rabbit-AAV (reisenhibiki.github.io)](https://reisenhibiki.github.io/). I read MarkDown guide and learn the code to write this journal.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about 5 hours of my own time learning the bootstrap and use it in my practical. I also spent half an hour on learning markdown file code. not including time I spent on the practical.

### Content Insights
I realized the importance of learning bootstrap for frontend developing after reading the guide carefully. Bootstrap provides a powerful frontend toolkit. I can use it to make a responsive website that is appropriate in different devices quickly. I can make my own new css class design if the bootstrap doesn't have the design I want. I should learn the components and Utility API to disvoer more about bootstrap. I also realized the features of Markdown file are 'easy-to-read' and 'easy-to-write'.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Bootstrap is being used by many websites and IT companies. It's quite important to learn bootstrap for frontend developer because most comapnies require that skill. I feel that I am now better at learning from tutorials and videos. It didn't took me much time to learn and use github.io to put my website online. I have more experience to search and learn the knowledge I want. I am motivated to learn extra knowledge by myself for my possible career in the future. From this strategy to learning this week, I believe that it's a good start.
