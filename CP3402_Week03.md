### Estimated Hours
I spent about 4 hours learning wordpress and build new wordpress website. I spent about 2 hours of my own time learning and planning my assignment 1.

### Content Insights
I think wordpress is the most popular CMS in the world because there are many tutorials and plugins for it. The design of wordpress and joomla are nearly the same with little difference. I got rebuild my website easily by using the plugins on wordpress.

### Notes and Insights from group formation task
After the 'interveiw job', we have some ideas that what a group members should have to achieve good team work. Members should be active, which also needs the encouragement from other group members. To avoid problems, group members should be able to communicate and respect others. We should use voting to make big decision for the group.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I learned that how to be good at teamwork is also necessary for IT students because we need to cooperate with different departments and different clients. Wordpress is a popular CMS tool that could build a website in a short time. Learning how to handle the database and CMS tools is also important. We need to learn some backend knowledge while we are focusing on frontend technologies.
