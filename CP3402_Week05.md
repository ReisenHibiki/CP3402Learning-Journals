### Estimated Hours
I spent about 3 hours learning and doing this week prac. I spent much more time focuing and working on assignment 1.

### Content Insights
I learned that using the child theme can save our changes without influencing the parent theme. It allows us to save our changes when the theme updates. It could also keep the functionality when we customize the css and other files. Usually I use backup to make sure I can reduce the problems I made when developing. It would be more helpful to use both backup systems and child theme frequently, which makes sure the rollback won't waste too much efforts.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I realize the separation of different versions is quite important in developing. No one want to see their efforts disappear because of rollback. By separating different versions of the code, we can save the efforts we did and reupdate them if we have to rollback to old version. Saving Backup frequently is a good habit to avoid big mistake in career. If some team members make big mistakes, at least we can have time to find the problems and reupdate lateer.
