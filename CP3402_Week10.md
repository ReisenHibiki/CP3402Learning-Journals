### Estimated Hours
I spent around 3 hours watching videos and doing practical. 


### Content Insights
I realized that presentation is a valuable chance to leave good impression to others. To deliver a successful presentation, thorough preparation and repeated practice are essential. The first rehearsal helped me memorize the script clearly. During the second rehearsal, I identified areas for improvement. By the third rehearsal, I was able to speak fluently and confidently. It takes lots of efforts to prepare for a good presentation. This iterative process not only improved my presentation skills but also reinforced my understanding of the material, enabling me to communicate more effectively.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Presentation is a good chance to show what we have learned and accomplished. It's quite important for IT students to develop this skill because it enables us to effectively communicate our ideas, solutions, and progress to diverse audiences. When we meet the HR, we need to do presentation. When we work in the company, we need to do presentation. When we report to the manager or host a meeting, we still need this important ability. Therefore, developing this ability is essential for career development and professional success.
