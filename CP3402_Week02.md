### Estimated Hours
I spent about 3 hours learning joomla and fixing the problem on my local host. I spent about 2 hours of my own time learning and setting the joomla website online.

### Content Insights
I learned that joomla is a fast, easy and stable tool to build a dynamic websites. I can easily manage the content and update the articles by using the backend admin page. I can create and manage the users. I can create and maintan the database. However, using joomla website is quite different from using html, css and js. It's like a software that contains those functions for the users. I could make a beautiful web page after learning the options and settings in joomla.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Joomla and Wordpress are two popular CMS in the world. As a IT student, I should not only learn html, css and js, but also learn tools like bootstrap and CMS. Today many companies requires more skills such as vue and node.js. Learning CMS is an important step to get further understanding of frontend developing and e-commerce. I think I should focus on the wordpress later because it's more popular in the world.
