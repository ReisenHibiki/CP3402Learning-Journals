### Estimated Hours
I spent around 2 hours watching and learning php language. My group and I spent more than 5 hours working on our project. Sometimes I need to answer other member's questiones and help them solve the problem.


### Content Insights
I learned that php was used to be a popular language because it's easy to learn and use. Some companies are still using it today because it's cheap in developing. However, php is quite old and unpopular totday because of many reasons. For group work this week, I learned a lot while I was helping other members to solve their problem. Doing troubleshooting is difficult and annoying, but it also helps me get further understanding of the system.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I will check php but I don't think it's very popular nowadays. The developing of frontend and backend are changing rapidly since the technology is upgrading fast. I think it's always a good thing to know a new language which would be helpful to my insights of coding and developing. Handling the troubleshooting job in the team is quite difficult. I need to find the problems and the reasons with the description from others. And use my knowledge of the systems to create solutions. It's an important ability in the career, which could be very helpful in the work place.
