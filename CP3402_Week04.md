### Estimated Hours
I spent about 3 hours learning and building the environment on my local host. I spent about 2 hours of my own time learning and working on assignment 1.

### Content Insights
I learned that using the localhost develop environment, I can build, change and test the website before I upload it to the live servers. It's queite convenient and usual in the IT industry because we need to get the permission from our clients before we make any changes. I could also build backup on my loaclhost environment so I could fix the problems if something wrong occurs after updates.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The IT team could develop together in their localhost developing environment without changing the content on live servers. In some companies, the developing deparment could only update their changes with the permission from the manager or the clients. There are many rules we need to follow to avoid making big mistakes in work. As an IT student, I am pretty sure that having good habits in the workplace could avoid many problems. I learned that during the loaclhost developing practice this week.
